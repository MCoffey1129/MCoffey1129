- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Coffey
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in completing advanced projects in Machine Learning, which include:
     * Creating a model which will successfully out-perform the S&P 500 across multiple time-periods 
     * Create a game in python using Pygame
     * Create an unsupervised model capable of solving the above game
     * Implement and deploy a chatbot. 
     * Create a model capable of taking advantage of imperfect bookmaker pricing of Premier League fixtures

- ðŸ§  I'm currently studying for the AWS Certified Machine Learning Speciality exam in August, I am set to complete several courses on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing in Udemy over the next month (including courses on ML in AZURE). I am also taking the course "Machine Learning Using SAS Viya" on Coursera. I have just finished a certificate in Data Analytics from University College Dublin and completed several online Machine learning, Data Science and Statistics courses (see my Linkedin for more details)
